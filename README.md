# QSRHelper
A mathematica package for symbolic calculation of some type of Feynman diagrams which usually encountered in QCD Sum Rules calculation.

# Requirements
To use QSRHelper, you need FeynCalc 9.3.1, the requirement of the version of Mathematica haven't been test(it constructed on Mathematica 12.0). 

# installation
To install this package, put it in the $UserBaseDirectory of Mathematica
usually at C:\Users\usrname\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications for Windows or /home/username/.Mathmatica/Applicatons for Linux.

# usage
Please load FeynCalc before load QSRHelper.
For baisc usuage and simple example, see usuage.nb and exmaple.nb

# Note
The construction about this package is far from complete. I put it here is because it used in my paper(haven't publised), and I think it's better to publish the code so that it give a way to check the correctness.
