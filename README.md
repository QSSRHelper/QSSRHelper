# QSRHelper
A mathematica package for symbolic calculation of some type of Feynman diagrams which usually encountered in QCD Sum Rules calculation.

QSRHelper require FeynCalc 9.3.1

For baisc usuage and simple example, see usuage.m and exmaple.m


Note the construction about this package is far from complete. I put it here is because it used in my paper(haven't publised), and I think it's better to publish the code so that it give a way to check the correctness.
